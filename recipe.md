Your Ice Cream is ready to serve!!!!!!

 Before serving, remove the ice cream box from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes. 

 Then scoop out chocolate ice cream with an ice cream scooper. 
 If you are not able to scoop the ice cream easily, then let the ice cream be at room temperature for 5 to 6 minutes. 
 If its too hot where you live, then a couple of minutes is fine.

Serve chocolate ice cream in bowls or cups. 

You can also drizzle some chocolate sauce on the ice cream if you want.

Thank You !!!!
